A simple golang web server with basic logging, tracing, throttling, health check, graceful shutdown and zero dependencies.

This repository originated from **[this](https://gist.github.com/enricofoltran/10b4a980cd07cb02836f70a4ab3e72d7)** Github gist, featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16090977).

Contributions are welcome but the goal (challenge) is to keep the code as simple as possible and only use Go standard library :)
